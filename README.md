## OpenCataclysm Project 4.3.4 (15595)
OpenCataclysm is a little bit outdated, but I am working on cleaning up the code, 
and adding a lot of missing features. I have a ton of fixes but most of these 
haven't been added just yet.. The project is too much for just one person! I hope
that by offering what I have been working on, that others will submit bugs, and/or
help with fixing quests, SmartAI ETC.. Please Contribute back to the Project!

## Introduction

OpenCataclysm is based on TrinityCore, which is an *MMORPG* Framework based mostly in C++.

It is derived from *MaNGOS*, the *Massive Network Game Object Server*, and is
based on the code of that project with extensive changes over time to optimize,
improve and cleanup the codebase at the same time as improving the in-game
mechanics and functionality.

It is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged.

If you wish to contribute ideas or code please visit our site linked below or
make pull requests to our [Github repository](https://github.com/cbunting99/OpenCataclysm/pulls).
